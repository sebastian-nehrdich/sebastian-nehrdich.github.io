Recent advances in artificial intelligence and natural language processing have revolutionized information retrieval and question-answering systems. This talk introduces MITRASearch, a specialized search platform designed for exploring Buddhist literature preserved across Classical Asian languages including Chinese, Tibetan, Sanskrit, and PƒÅli. The system leverages multilingual approximate search capabilities to enable scholars to identify parallel passages and conduct comparative analyses across different writing systems and translations. We demonstrate how large language models integrated into the Dharmamitra project enhance user interaction with search results, facilitating dynamic exploration of these classical texts. This innovation addresses the long-standing challenge of cross-linguistic textual research in Buddhist studies and offers new possibilities for digital humanities scholarship.
