This paper presents the development of SansTib, a Sanskrit - Classical Tibetan parallel corpus automatically aligned on sentence-level, and a bilingual sentence embedding model. The corpus has a size of about 317,289 sentence pairs and 14,420,771 tokens and thereby is a considerable improvement over previous resources for these two languages. The data is incorporated into the BuddhaNexus database to make it accessible to a larger audience. It also presents a gold evaluation dataset and assesses the quality of the automatic alignment.
