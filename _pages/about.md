I am working as the CTO of the [MITRA](https://dharmamitra.org) project under the guidance of Kurt Keutzer at BAIR, UC Berkeley. My interests are machine learning, natural language processing, and especially the intersection between Buddhist Studies and NLP applications. 
Since 2023, I am a PhD student at University of Duesseldorf, Germany.
